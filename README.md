# OPTIGA&trade; Trust M: MQTT Client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of an MQTT Client using the [ModusToolbox&trade; MQTT Client library](https://github.com/Infineon/mqtt). The library uses the AWS IoT Device SDK MQTT Client library that includes an MQTT 3.1.1 Client and OPTIGA&trade; Trust M secure element.

**Figure 1. Connection between PSOC&trade; 6 host MCU and OPTIGA&trade; Trust M**

![](images/mqtt_optiga_trust_m.png)

In this example, the MQTT Client RTOS task reads out a pre-provisioned X.509 certificate out of the secure element and populates the internal MQTT Client configuration to establish a connection with the configured MQTT Broker, and creates two tasks:

- **Publisher:** Publishes messages on a topic when the user button on the kit is pressed.

- **Subscriber:** Subscribes to the same topic and controls the user LED based on the messages received from the MQTT Broker.

If an unexpected MQTT or Wi-Fi disconnection occurs, the application executes a reconnection mechanism to restore the connection. In addition, all operations related to ECDSA and ECDHE that are performed as part of this demo, i.e., as part of the TLS channel establishment, are automatically accelerated on the secure element.

## Operation

+ [Step 1. Register your X.509 device certificate at AWS IoT](#step-1-register-your-x509-device-certificate-at-aws-iot)
+ [Step 2. Configure the application](#step-2-configure-the-application)
+ [Step 3. Program](#step-3-program)
+ [Alternative methods to verify the publish and subscribe functionality](#alternative-methods-to-verify-the-publish-and-subscribe-functionality)


### Step 1. Register your X.509 device certificate at AWS IoT

1. Set up the MQTT device (also known as **thing**) in the AWS IoT core as described in the [Getting started with AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-gs.html) tutorial. <br> Do not create a client certificate or a corresponding private key as they will be provided by the secure element.

   > **Note:** While setting up your device, ensure that the policy associated with this device permits all MQTT operations (*iot:Connect*, *iot:Publish*, *iot:Receive*, and *iot:Subscribe*) for the resource used by this device. For testing purposes, it is recommended to have the following policy document, which allows all **MQTT Policy Actions** on all **Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)**.
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "iot:*",
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
2. Download the device certificate from the CIRRENT&trade; Cloud ID as per instructions on the OPTIGA&trade; Trust IoT Security Development Kit package. 
3. On the **Device Management** tab, navigate to **Cloud ID** > **Actions** > **Download the list of certificates**. <br> This downloads a zip archive with a *.CSV* file inside with the following content:

    > **Note:** If your board doesn't have a QR code to claim the device certificate, follow **Step 3. Program** and flash your board (even if it doesn't contain the correct configuration). You should be able to see your personal certificate extracted from the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M secure element, which you can use as follows:

    ```
    "device_id","group_id","certificate"
    "d6c5a999890f44f843c34a9013e43c0372c59b14","D003",

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    "
    ```

4. Copy and paste the content starting from the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` to `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` in a *PEM* file and name it *certificate.pem*.

5. Register your *certificate.pem* file at your AWS IoT endpoint:

    1. In the navigation pane for the AWS IoT console, click **Secure** > **Certificates**.

    2. On the **Certificates** page, click **Create a certificate**.

    3. Next to **Use my certificate**, click **Get started**.

    4. On the **Select a CA** page, leave the field blank and click **Next**.

       Multi-Account Registration does not require you to register a certificate authority with AWS.

    5. On the **Register existing device certificates** page, click **Select certificates** and select the certificate you recently saved (*certificate.pem*).

    6. Ensure the **Activate All** option is selected and click **Register certificate**.

    7. Click **Actions** > **Attach policy** > **Attach** to attach the policy that you created.

    8. Attach your certificate to the **thing** you created earlier. On the **Certificates** page, select the certificate you just created.

    9. Click **Actions**, and then click **Attach thing**.

    10. On the **Attach things to certificate(s)** window, select the **Thing name** and click **Attach**.


### Step 2. Configure the application

1. Set the Wi-Fi credentials in *configs/wifi_config.h* to modify the user configuration files in the *configs* directory. Modify the macros `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY` to match the Wi-Fi network you want to connect to.

2. Navigate to the [AWS IoT Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com). In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

    Your AWS IoT endpoint is displayed in **Endpoint**. It should look like `1234567890123-ats.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. Make a note of this endpoint.

3. In the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file, set `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS` and `MQTT_SNI_HOSTNAME` to your custom endpoint on the **Settings** page of the AWS IoT Console.

4. In the *configs/mqtt_client_config.h* file, set the following macros:

    - `MQTT_PORT`: Set to `8883`.
    - `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION`: Set to `1`.

5. Download the **Root CA "ECC 256 bit key"** (Amazon Root CA 3) for AWS IoT from [CA certificates for server authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/server-authentication.html#server-authentication-certs).

    Perform the following based on the TLS cipher suite:
    
    - **Based on ECDHE_ECDSA:** Select the [Amazon Root CA 3](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA3.pem) (Default).
    - **Based on ECDHE_RSA:** Select another CA â€“ [Amazon Root CA 1](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem).

6. Using these certificates, enter the following parameters in *mqtt_client_config.h* in PEM format:

    - `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`: Root CA certificate

       You can either convert the values to strings manually following the format shown in *mqtt_client_config.h* or you can use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/Infineon/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

       For a full list of configuration macros used in this code example, see See **Table 1** from the [Configuring the MQTT Client](#configuring-the-mqtt-client) section.

7. (Optional) Modify the configuration macros in the following files according to your application:

    - *configs/core_mqtt_config.h* used by the [MQTT library](https://github.com/Infineon/mqtt)

    - *configs/FreeRTOSConfig.h* used by the [FreeRTOS library](https://github.com/Infineon/freertos)


### Step 3. Program

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following (you don't need any extra configuration for the first part):


    <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

    From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
    make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
    make program TARGET=CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to make all the required connections.

   **Figure 4. Application initialization status**

   ![](images/application_initialization.png)


4. Confirm that the following message is printed on the UART terminal:

    ```
    Press the user button (SW2) to publish "TURN ON"/"TURN OFF" on the topic 'ledstatus'...
    ```
    This message may vary depending on the MQTT topic and publish messages that are configured in the *mqtt_client_config.h* file.

5. Press the user button (SW2) on the kit to toggle the LED state.

6. Confirm that the user LED state is toggled and the messages received on the subscribed topic are printed on the UART terminal.

   **Figure 5. Publisher and subscriber logs**

   ![](images/publish_subscribe_messages.png)

This example can be programmed on multiple kits (only when `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID` is set to `1`); the user LEDs on all the kits will synchronously toggle with a button press on any kit.


### Alternative methods to verify the publish and subscribe functionality

You can individually verify the publish and subscribe functionalities of the MQTT Client if the MQTT Broker supports a Test MQTT Client such as AWS IoT.

- **Verify the subscribe functionality:** Using the Test MQTT Client, publish messages such as "TURN ON" and "TURN OFF" on the topic specified by the `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC` macro in *mqtt_client_config.h* to control the LED state on the kit.

- **Verify the publish functionality:** From the Test MQTT Client, subscribe to the MQTT topic specified by the `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC` macro and confirm that the messages published by the kit (when the user button is pressed) are displayed on the Test MQTT Client's console.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This example implements the following RTOS tasks:

- OPTIGA&trade; Trust
- MQTT Client
- MQTT Publisher
- MQTT Subscriber

The main function initializes the BSP and the retarget-io library, and creates the OPTIGA&trade; Trust task.

The OPTIGA&trade; Trust task does the following:

1. Initializes the secure element

2. Extracts the pre-provisioned public key certificate from the chip

3. Populates the public key certificate with the internal configuration for secure communication

4. Initializes the MQTT Client task

The MQTT Client task does the following:

1. Initializes the Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM) and connects to a Wi-Fi access point (AP) using the Wi-Fi network credentials configured in *wifi_config.h*

2. Upon a successful Wi-Fi connection, it initializes the MQTT library and establishes a connection with the MQTT Broker/Server

The MQTT connection is configured to be secure by default; the secure connection requires a client certificate, a private key, and the Root CA certificate of the MQTT Broker that are configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*.

After a successful MQTT connection, the Subscriber and Publisher tasks are created. The MQTT Client task then waits for commands from the other two tasks and callbacks to handle events such as unexpected disconnections.

The Subscriber task initializes the user LED GPIO and subscribes to messages on the topic specified by the `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC` macro that are configured in *mqtt_client_config.h*. When the Subscriber task receives a message from the Broker, it turns the user LED ON or OFF depending on whether the received message is "TURN ON" or "TURN OFF" (configured using the `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` and `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE` macros).

The Publisher task sets up the user button GPIO and configures an interrupt for the button. The ISR notifies the Publisher task when a button press is detected. The Publisher task then publishes messages (*TURN ON* / *TURN OFF*) on the topic specified by the `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC` macro. When the publish operation fails, a message is sent over a queue to the MQTT Client task.

An MQTT event callback function `mqtt_event_callback()` is invoked by the MQTT library for events such as MQTT disconnection and incoming MQTT subscription messages from the MQTT Broker. In the case of an MQTT disconnection, the MQTT Client task is informed about the disconnection using a message queue. When an MQTT subscription message is received, the subscriber callback function implemented in *subscriber_task.c* is invoked to handle the incoming MQTT message.

The MQTT Client task handles unexpected disconnections in the MQTT or Wi-Fi connections by initiating reconnection to restore the Wi-Fi and MQTT connections. Upon failure, the Publisher and Subscriber tasks are deleted, cleanup operations of various libraries are performed, and then the MQTT client task is terminated.


### Sequence of operation

1. The user button is pressed.

2. The GPIO interrupt service routine (ISR) notifies the Publisher task.

3. The Publisher task publishes a message on a topic.

4. The MQTT Broker sends back the message to the MQTT Client because it is also subscribed to the same topic.

5. When the message is received, the Subscriber task turns the LED ON or OFF. As a result, the user LED toggles every time the user presses the button.

### Configuration


#### I2C Pins

Supported boards have `CYBSP_I2C_SCL_OPTIGA` and `CYBSP_I2C_SDA_OPTIGA` defined in their BSP. Alternatively, you can define these in the *[optiga_lib_mtb_config.h](source/optiga_lib_config_mtb.h#L161-L162)* file.


#### Reset and power control pins

The OPTIGA&trade; Trust secure element can be controlled via a dedicated reset and a power control line. For example, the power control line is used to enter hibernate mode on the chip.

Do the following:

1. Define `OPTIGA_TRUSTM_VDD` and `OPTIGA_TRUSTM_RST` with the corresponding GPIOs in your *optiga_lib_config_mtb.h* file.

2. Change the reset type (`OPTIGA_COMMS_DEFAULT_RESET_TYPE`) as appropriate:

   - If both macros are defined, set this value to `0`.

   - If only the reset line is connected, set this value to `2`.


#### Initialization in a FreeRTOS task

If the [*Makefile*](Makefile#L81) defines `PSOC_FREERTOS`, it means that the OPTIGA&trade; Trust library uses a FreeRTOS-based Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) for the communication. In this case, ensure to: 

- Always initialize the secure element from a task.

- Allocate enough stack (not more than 3072 bytes) to the OPTIGA&trade; Trust task, depending on the configuration it needs.

- Do not start any MQTT-related tasks before the secure element is initialized.


#### Certificate extraction and MQTT connection configuration

Immediately after the secure element is initialized, you might need to extract the certificate from the chip and assign it to the internal MQTT Client configuration. For an example, click [here](source/mqtt_client_config.c#L171).


#### mbed TLS configuration

For a successful TLS communication, make sure that only supported handshake methods are selected in your mbed TLS configuration file.

To do this, do **one** of the following:

-  Undefine the following:
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_DHE_PSK_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_PSK_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_RSA_PSK_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_RSA_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_DHE_RSA_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDH_RSA_ENABLED`
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_RSA_ENABLED`

- Define the following:
   - `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_ECDSA_ENABLED`

If Wi-Fi online provisioning is used, your example will try to establish a connection with several clouds. This restricts the use of many handshake methods. For example, the `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_ECDSA_ENABLED` method might be not available. You can choose the `MBEDTLS_KEY_EXCHANGE_ECDHE_RSA_ENABLED` and change the Root CA configuration (`ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`) to use the Amazon Root CA 1 (based on RSA 2048), instead of the default value of Amazon Root CA 3 (based on ECC 256).


#### Cryptography (ECDSA, ECDHE, Random) functions call routing

Ensure that your mbed TLS configuration file has the following macros defined:

- `MBEDTLS_ECDH_GEN_PUBLIC_ALT`
- `MBEDTLS_ECDSA_SIGN_ALT`
- `MBEDTLS_ECDSA_VERIFY_ALT`
- `MBEDTLS_ECDH_COMPUTE_SHARED_ALT`
- `MBEDTLS_ECDSA_GENKEY_ALT`

In addition to these macros, ensure that your build includes the *$(optiga-trust-m)/examples/mbedtls_port* files.


#### Custom certificates and keys

If you do not have your own credentials for the connection, but want to generate them, see the [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M: Data and certificates management](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-optiga-data-management) code example.
If you would like to use existing credentials and would like to change default Object IDs, edit the *Makefile* and add the following macros to `DEFINES`:

- `LABEL_DEVICE_PRIVATE_KEY_FOR_TLS='"0xE0F1"'` to define a private key slot of the PKCS11 Engine (secure-sockets middleware library), where `'"0xE0F1"'` value can be of your choice.
- `CONFIG_OPTIGA_TRUST_M_PRIVKEY_SLOT=0xE0F1` to define the private key slot of the mbedtls alternative implementation, where `0xe0F1` is the same value as specified above. Keep in mind, that here no additional signs `'"` are required
- `LABEL_DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_FOR_TLS='"0xE0E1"'` to define a matching certificate to the private key mentioned above of the PKCS11 Engine, where `'"0xE0E1"'` value can be of your choice.

## Shielded connection for OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express and OPTIGA Trust M MTR
[OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/security-smart-card-solutions/optiga-embedded-security-solutions/optiga-trust/optiga-trust-m-express/) and [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M MTR](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/security-smart-card-solutions/optiga-embedded-security-solutions/optiga-trust/optiga-trust-m-mtr/) come with a pre-provisioned platform binding secret (PBS), which enables the shielded connection. This PBS must also be known to the host if the shielded connection is to be used.

The shielded connection is not used by default in this example. If you want to use it in combination with OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express or MTR chips, remember to set the matching secret `uint8_t optiga_platform_binding_shared_secret` in *COMPONENT_OPTIGA_PAL_FREERTOS/pal_os_datastore.c*.

### Configuring the MQTT Client


**Table 1. Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration macros**

 Macro                     |  Description              
 :-------------------------| :------------------------ 
 **Wi-Fi connection configuration**  |  In *configs/wifi_config.h*
 `WIFI_SSID`       | SSID of the Wi-Fi AP to which the MQTT Client connects
 `WIFI_PASSWORD`   | Passkey/password for the Wi-Fi SSID specified above          
 `WIFI_SECURITY`   | Security type of the Wi-Fi AP. See the `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in the *cy_wcm.h* file for more details.
 `MAX_WIFI_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for the Wi-Fi connection
 `WIFI_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in-between successive Wi-Fi connection retries 
 **MQTT connection configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS`      | Host name of the MQTT Broker
 `MQTT_PORT`                | Port number to be used for the MQTT connection. As specified by the internet assigned numbers authority (IANA), port numbers assigned for the MQTT protocol are **1883** for non-secure connections and **8883** for secure connections. However, MQTT Brokers may use other ports. Configure this macro as specified by the MQTT Broker.
 `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION`   | Set this macro to `1` if your application requires establishing a secure (TLS) connection to the MQTT Broker; else `0`.
 `MQTT_USERNAME` <br> `MQTT_PASSWORD`   | User name and password for client authentication and authorization, if required by the MQTT Broker. However, note that this information is generally not encrypted and the password is sent in plain text. Therefore, this is not a recommended method of client authentication.
 **MQTT Client certificate configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` <br> `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`  | Certificate and private key of the MQTT Client used for client authentication. Note that these macros are applicable only when `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` is set to `1`.
 `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`      |  Root CA certificate of the MQTT Broker
 **MQTT message configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the messages are published by the Publisher task to the MQTT Broker
 `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the Subscriber task subscribes. The MQTT Broker sends the messages to the Subscriber that are published in this topic (or equivalent topic).
 `MQTT_MESSAGES_QOS`        | Quality of service (QoS) level to be used by the Publisher and Subscriber. Valid choices are `0`, `1`, and `2`.
 `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE`       | Set this macro to `1` if you want to use the 'last will and testament (LWT)' option; else `0`. LWT is an MQTT message that will be published by the MQTT Broker on the specified topic if the MQTT connection is unexpectedly closed. This configuration is sent to the MQTT Broker during the MQTT connect operation; the MQTT Broker will publish the Will message on the Will topic when it recognizes an unexpected disconnection from the client.
 `MQTT_WILL_TOPIC_NAME` <br> `MQTT_WILL_MESSAGE`   | MQTT topic and message for the LWT option described above. These configurations are applicable only when `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE` is set to `1`.
 `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` <br> `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE`  | MQTT messages that control the device (LED) state in this code example
 **Other MQTT Client configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID`   | Every active MQTT connection must have a unique client identifier. If this macro is set to `1`, the device will generate a unique client identifier by appending a timestamp to the string specified by the `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` macro. This feature is useful if you are using the same code on multiple kits simultaneously.
 `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER`     | Client identifier (client ID) string to be used during an MQTT connection. If `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID` is set to `1`, a timestamp is appended to this macro value and used as the client ID; else, the value specified for this macro is directly used as the client ID.
 `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER_MAX_LEN`   | The longest client identifier that an MQTT Server must accept (as defined by the MQTT 3.1.1 spec) is 23 characters. However, some MQTT Brokers support longer client IDs. Configure this macro as per the MQTT Broker specification.
 `MQTT_TIMEOUT_MS`            | Timeout in milliseconds for MQTT operations in this example
 `MQTT_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS`    | Keep a live interval in seconds used for the MQTT ping request
 `MQTT_ALPN_PROTOCOL_NAME`   | Application layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) protocol name to be used that is supported by the MQTT Broker in use. Note that this is an optional macro for most of the use cases. <br> Per IANA, the port numbers assigned for the MQTT protocol are 1883 for non-secure connections and 8883 for secure connections. Some applications may need to use other ports for MQTT such as port 443 (which is reserved for HTTPS). ALPN is an extension for TLS that allows many protocols to be used over a secure connection.
 `MQTT_SNI_HOSTNAME`   | Server Name Indication (SNI) host name to be used during a TLS connection as specified by the MQTT Broker. <br> SNI is an extension to the TLS protocol. As required by some MQTT Brokers, SNI typically includes the hostname in the "Client Hello" message sent during a TLS handshake.
 `MQTT_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE`   | Size of the network buffer allocated for sending and receiving MQTT packets over the network. Note that the minimum buffer size is defined by the `CY_MQTT_MIN_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE` macro in the MQTT library.
 `MAX_MQTT_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for an MQTT connection
 `MQTT_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in between successive MQTT connection retries
<br>


### Resources and settings

**Table 2. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port
 GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED         | User LED controlled by the Subscriber based on incoming MQTT messages  |
 GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_BTN         | User button used to notify the Publisher to publish MQTT messages


Add `MBEDTLS_VERBOSE=4` and `ENABLE_SECURE_SOCKETS_LOGS` in the Makefile to the end of the `DEFINES` list after a whitespace to enable an verbose output of mbedtls in case you have a problem during the TLS channel establishment, the Makefile content should be then similar to the following:

```
DEFINES=$(MBEDTLSFLAGS) $(OPTIGAFLAGS) CYBSP_WIFI_CAPABLE CY_RETARGET_IO_CONVERT_LF_TO_CRLF CY_CRYPTO_HAL_DISABLE MBEDTLS_VERBOSE=4
```
